Assignments 1 and 2 for JB5. 

As many unit tests were implemented as possible (all methods that returned a type).
Due to how some methods were written, void methods are not unit tested as I have had a bit trouble unit testing with Mockito. The void methods performed the logic AND printing.
I could have rewritten them to perform further unit testing (by separating: a) the logic to be in a method with a return type from the b) printing and other utility in the void)
however, I felt -- and was advised -- it was best to move on and focus on the final project. 

I'll keep this in mind going forward and learn more about Mockito to be better prepared by the time of evaluations.
